# Lesson 13 - Program Synthesis

* Follow the synthesis tutorial in your favorite language to build a sketch-based expression synthesis engine. You can use Python and Z3 directly, as in Adrian’s tutorial, or try Rosette, as in James Bornholt’s tutorial.
* Add an extension to generate more complex expressions than the ternary and bit-shift expressions from the tutorial. Get creative!
* Write a couple of example sketches that show off your new language extension, and report on how hard it was to get the solver to discharge them.
